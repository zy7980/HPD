# Molecule-matched personalized combination therapies provide improved survival outcomes for hyperprogressive disease after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: a retrospective study from the molecular tumor board registry database

# Overview

Hyperprogressive disease (HPD) is an emerging and life-threatening phenomenon in oncology, characterized by rapid tumor acceleration following treatment, particularly with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Currently, no established treatment exists for HPD, presenting a critical unmet clinical need. In our retrospective analysis of 40 HPD patients, a real-time, molecular tumor board (MTB)-guided molecule-matched treatment (MT) based on actionable targets (MT with high-level evidence, MTH), significantly improved median overall survival (OS) to 15.12 months, compared to 3.32 months with palliative care/no treatment. To our knowledge, this is among the first studies to demonstrate improved outcomes in HPD patients through an MTB-guided precision oncology approach, highlighting its significant clinical impact in HPD management. Survival advantages were observed even in MT with low–level evidence (MTL) group (e.g., FGF/FGFR, RAS/RAS-STK11, and TP53), with median OS of 9.47 months, suggesting broader applicability of precision-driven strategies. MT achieved clinical benefit (PFS ratio ≥1.3) in 87.0% of patients, with 66.7% showing improved ECOG performance status post-treatment in those very vulnerable patients with ECOG ≥ 2. This approach proved feasible in a time-sensitive clinical setting where rapid intervention is crucial for HPD. Notably, the MTB-guided strategy adopted a histology-agnostic framework, targeting tumors based on molecular profiles rather than cancer type, particularly for high-risk HPD patients..
