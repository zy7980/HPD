# Overview

Hyperprogressive disease (HPD) is an emerging and life-threatening phenomenon in oncology, characterized by rapid tumor acceleration following treatment, particularly with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Currently, no established treatment exists for HPD, presenting a critical unmet clinical need. In our retrospective analysis of 40 HPD patients, a real-time, molecular tumor board (MTB)-guided molecule-matched treatment (MT) based on actionable targets (MT with high-level evidence, MTH), significantly improved median overall survival (OS) to 15.12 months, compared to 3.32 months with palliative care/no treatment. To our knowledge, this is among the first studies to demonstrate improved outcomes in HPD patients through an MTB-guided precision oncology approach, highlighting its significant clinical impact in HPD management. Survival advantages were observed even in MT with lowâ€“level evidence (MTL) group (e.g., FGF/FGFR, RAS/RAS-STK11, and TP53), with median OS of 9.47 months, suggesting broader applicability of precision-driven strategies. MT achieved clinical benefit (PFS ratio â‰¥1.3) in 87.0% of patients, with 66.7% showing improved ECOG performance status post-treatment in those very vulnerable patients with ECOG â‰¥ 2. This approach proved feasible in a time-sensitive clinical setting where rapid intervention is crucial for HPD. Notably, the MTB-guided strategy adopted a histology-agnostic framework, targeting tumors based on molecular profiles rather than cancer type, particularly for high-risk HPD patients..

#### Installing R version 3.4.2 on Ubuntu 16.04

the latest version of R can be installed by adding the latest repository to `apt`:

```
sudo echo "deb http://cran.rstudio.com/bin/linux/ubuntu xenial/" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-key E084DAB9
gpg -a --export E084DAB9 | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install r-base r-base-dev
```

which should install in about 20 seconds.

# Installation Guide

## Stable Release

`lolR` is available in a stable release on CRAN:

```
install.packages('lolR')
```

## Development Version

### Package dependencies

Users should install the following packages prior to installing `lolR`, from an `R` terminal:

```
install.packages(c('ggplot2', 'abind', 'irlba', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown', 'latex2exp', 'MASS', 'randomForest'))
```

which will install in about 30 seconds on a machine with the recommended specs.

The `lolR` package functions with all packages in their latest versions as they appear on `CRAN` on December 13, 2017. Users can check [CRAN snapshot](https://mran.microsoft.com/timemachine/) for details. The versions of software are, specifically:
```
abind_1.4-5
latex2exp_0.4.0
ggplot2_2.2.1
irlba_2.3.1
Matrix_1.2-3
MASS_7.3-47
randomForest_4.6-12
```

If you are having an issue that you believe to be tied to software versioning issues, please drop us an [Issue](https://github.com/neurodata/lol/issues). 

### Package Installation

From an `R` session, type:

```
require(devtools)
install_github('neurodata/lol', build_vignettes=TRUE, force=TRUE)  # install lol with the vignettes
require(lolR)
vignette("lol", package="lolR")  # view one of the basic vignettes
```

The package should take approximately 40 seconds to install with vignettes on a recommended computer. 

# Demo

## Functions

For interactive demos of the functions, please check out the vignettes built into the package. They can be accessed as follows:

```
require(lolR)
vignette('lol')
vignette('pca')
vignette('cpca')
vignette('lrcca')
vignette('mdp')
vignette('xval')
vignette('qoq')
vignette('simulations')
vignette('nearestCentroid')
```

## Extending the lolR Package

The lolR package makes many useful resources available (such as embedding and cross-validation) for simple extension. 

To extend the lolR package, check out the vignettes:

```
require(lolR)
vignette('extend_embedding')
vignette('extend_classification')
```

# Results

In this [benchmark comparison](http://docs.neurodata.io/lol/lol-paper/figures/real_data.html), we show that LOL does better than all linear embedding techniques in supervised HDLSS settings when dimensionality is high (d > 100, ntrain <= d) on 20 benchmark problems from the [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) and [PMLB](https://github.com/EpistasisLab/penn-ml-benchmarks) datasets. LOL provides a good tradeoff between maintaining the class conditional difference (good misclassification rate) in a small number of dimensions (low number of embedding dimensions).
